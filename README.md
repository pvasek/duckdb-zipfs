This is a [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org) extension that adds support for reading files from within [zip archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)).

# Get started

Load from the [community extensions repository](https://community-extensions.duckdb.org/extensions/zipfs.html):
```SQL
INSTALL zipfs FROM community;
LOAD zipfs;
```

To read a file:
```SQL
SELECT * FROM 'zip://examples/a.zip/a.csv';
```

To read a file from azure blob storage (or other file system):
```SQL
SELECT * FROM 'zip://az://yourstorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/yourcontainer/examples/a.zip/a.csv';
```

## File names

File names passed into the `zip://` URL scheme are expected to end with `.zip`, which indicates the end of the zip file name. The path after
that is taken to be the file path within the zip archive.

Globbing within the zip archive is supported, but see below for performance limitations. A glob query looks like:
```SQL
SELECT * FROM 'zip://examples/a.zip/*.csv';
```

Globbing for multiple zip files:
```SQL
SELECT * FROM 'zip://examples/*.zip/*.csv';
```

## Performance considerations

This extension is intended more for convience than high performance. It does not implement a file metadata cache as `tarfs` (on which this
extension is based) does. As such, operations which require the central directory (index) of the zip file, such as globbing files, must
reread the central directory multiple times, once for the glob and once for each file to open.
